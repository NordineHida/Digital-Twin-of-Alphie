## Overview

Welcome to the Digital Twin of Rover ALPHIE repository! This repository contains everything you need to simulate the Rover ALPHIE developed by the [Institut Agro Dijon](https://institut-agro-dijon.fr/). The simulation environment includes a user-friendly remote interface, enabling users to seamlessly send commands to the robots using their keyboard.

## Missions

Explore various missions with ALPHIE! The repository comes pre-loaded with a set of missions, and it's easy to add more in the future. Current missions include:

- **Navigation to Specific Coordinates:** Guide ALPHIE to predefined coordinates within the simulation environment.
- **Circuit Formation:** Define a series of coordinates to create a circuit for ALPHIE to follow.

These missions provide a starting point for experimentation and development, and the flexibility to expand the missions.
